# amazon_makeup_tool2
## Purpose:
As the 21st century unfolds, the need for makeup categorization and customization arises. However, to find reviews for makeup and skincare products that are suitable for each of us, we usually have to watch tons of videos and scroll through hundreds of comments. By implementing and utilizing Python, we've created a tool to retrieve reviews and prices for each product that suits oily, normal, and dry skin.


## Python concepts used: 
We used file handling, if-else statements, lists and dictionaries, for loops.

## Challenging part:
The most challenging part of our project was fleshing out our thought process for the logic behind sorting products based on the user input, as well as how to collaborate effectively with each other using Git and GitHub.

## What we achieved:
This project has helped us solidify our knowledge of Python concepts and gain a deeper understanding of the needs and behaviors of consumers these days. Additionally, the part that we are most proud of is the review retrieval part. In this section, we have used AI summarization to condense the reviews that the customers provided for each product. By doing this, we can identify both the pros and cons of a product, as well as who the target customer is for the product.
